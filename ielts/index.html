<p>
<strong>30 minutes</strong><br>
<br>
You will listen to four recordings of native English speakers and then write your answers to a series of questions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recording 1 &ndash; a conversation between two people set in an everyday social context.</li>
    <li>Recording 2 - a monologue set in an everyday social context, e.g. a speech about local facilities.</li>
    <li>Recording 3 &ndash; a conversation between up to four people set in an educational or training context, e.g. a university tutor and a student discussing an assignment.</li>
    <li>Recording 4 - a monologue on an academic subject, e.g. a university lecture.</li>
</ul>
Assessors will be looking for evidence of your ability to understand the main ideas and detailed factual information, the opinions and attitudes of speakers, the purpose of an utterance and evidence of your ability to follow the development of ideas.<br>

In Part 1, there is a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements), and in Part 2, there is a monologue in (for example, a speech about local facilities). The final two parts deal with situations set in educational and training contexts. In Part 3, there is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, two university students in discussion, perhaps guided by a tutor), and in Part 4, there is a monologue on an academic subject. </p>
            <p>The recordings are heard only once. They include a range of accents, including British, Australian, New Zealand, American and Canadian.</p>

<h3>IELTS Listening &ndash; how it's marked</h3>
<p>The Listening test is marked by certificated markers, who are regularly monitored to ensure their reliability. All answer sheets, after being marked, are further analysed by Cambridge Assessment English.</p>
<p><strong>Band score conversion </strong></p>
<p>A Band Score conversion table is produced for each version of the Listening test which translates scores out of 40 into the IELTS 9-band scale. Scores are reported in whole bands and half bands.</p>
<p>One mark is awarded for each correct answer in the 40-item test. Care should be taken when writing answers on the answer sheet as poor spelling and grammar are penalised.</p>

(Any knowledge students bring with them from outside the passage should not play a part when deciding on their answers.</p>

Topics are of general interest to, and suitable for, test takers entering undergraduate and postgraduate studies or seeking professional registration. There are two tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Task 1 </strong>- you will be presented with a graph, table, chart or diagram and asked to describe, summarise or explain the information in your own words. You may be asked to describe and explain data, describe the stages of a process, how something works or describe an object or event.</li>
    <li><strong>Task 2</strong> - you will be asked to write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem. Responses to both tasks must be in a formal style. </li>

<h3 class="slidePanel">IELTS Academic Writing - How it's marked</h3>
<h4 class="slidePanel">Marking and assessment</h4>
<div class="slidePanel">Each task is assessed independently. The assessment of Task 2 carries more weight in marking than Task 1. </div>
<p class="slidePanel">Responses are assessed by certificated IELTS examiners. All IELTS examiners hold relevant teaching qualifications and are recruited as examiners by the test centres and approved by the British Council or IDP: IELTS Australia.</p>
<p class="slidePanel">Scores are reported in whole and half bands. Detailed performance descriptors have been developed which describe written performance at the nine IELTS bands. These are available on the <a href="/for-test-takers/how-ielts-is-scored" class="red-text">How IELTS is scored</a> page. They apply to both IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training versions and are based on the following criteria.</p>
<p class="slidePanel"><strong>Task 1 responses are assessed on:<br>
</strong></p>
<div class="slidePanel">
<ul>
    <li>Task achievement</li>
    <li>Coherence and cohesion</li>
    <li>Lexical resource</li>
    <li>Grammatical range and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Task 2 responses are assessed on:</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li>Task response</li>
    <li>Coherence and cohesion</li>
    <li>Lexical resource</li>
    <li>Grammatical range and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance descriptors </h3>
<p><strong>Task 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task achievement</strong> <br>
This assesses how appropriately, accurately and relevantly the response fulfils the requirements set out in the task, using the minimum of 150 words. Academic Writing Task 1 is a writing task which has a defined input and a largely predictable output. It is basically an information-transfer task that relates narrowly to the factual content of an input diagram and not to speculative explanations that lie outside the given data. </p>
<p><strong>Coherence and cohesion</strong> <br>
This  concerns overall clarity and fluency: how the response organises and links information, ideas and language. Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing. Cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns and conjunctions) to assist in making the conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences clear.</p>
<p><strong>Lexical resource</strong> <br>
This refers to the range of vocabulary used and its accuracy and appropriacy in terms of the specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy</strong> <br>
This refers to the range and accurate use of grammar as manifested in their sentence writing.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task response <br>
</strong>In both IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training versions, Task 2 requires test takers to formulate and develop a position in relation to a given prompt in the form of a question or statement. Ideas should be supported by evidence, and examples may be drawn from the test takers’ own experience. Responses must be at least 250 words in length. Scripts under the required minimum word limit will be penalised.</p>
<p><strong>Coherence and cohesion</strong> <br>
This assesses the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organises and links information, ideas and language. Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing. Cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns and conjunctions) to assist in making the conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences clear.</p>
<p><strong>Lexical resource <br>
</strong>This criterion refers to the range of vocabulary used and its accuracy and appropriacy in terms of the specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy</strong> <br>
This assesses the range and accurate use of grammar, as manifested in their test takers’ writing at sentence level.</p>

            <td>
            <p>In Writing Task 1, test takers are presented with a situation and required to write a personal response in the form of an informal, semi-formal or formal letter of at least 150 words in the answer booklet provided. The situations they are asked to write about are common, everyday ones such as: writing to a college accommodation officer about problems with accommodation, writing to a new employer about time management problems they are having, writing to a local newspaper about a plan to develop a local airport, writing to a renting agency to sort out problems with the heating system in their house.</p>
            <p>Test takers are told what kind of information (in the form of three bullet points) they must include in their response. They may be required to request or give information and/or explain a situation. To do this, they may need to do some of the following: ask for and/or provide general factual information, express needs, wants, likes or dislikes, express opinions or complaints, make requests or make suggestions/recommendations.</p>
            <p>The style of writing that test takers use depends who they are asked to write to (i.e. the audience) and how well they are supposed to know them. They need to write in a style that is appropriate for their audience and that will help them to achieve their purpose for writing, e.g. writing to a friend (informal) or writing to a manager (semi-formal or formal). Test takers do not need to include any addresses at the head of their letters.</p>
            <p>Test takers should spend no more than 20 minutes on this task. They are asked to write at least 150 words and will be penalised if their answer is too short. While test takers will not be penalised for writing more than 150 words, they should remember that a longer Task 1 answer may mean that they have less time to spend on Task 2, which contributes twice as much to the Writing band score.</p>
            <p>Test takers should also note that they will be penalised for irrelevance, if the response is off-topic or is not written as full, connected text (e.g. using bullet points in any part of the response, or note form, etc.). They will be severely penalised for plagiarism (i.e. copying from another source). </p>

<h4>Task 2</h4>

            <p>In Writing Task 2, test takers write a semi-formal/neutral discursive essay of at least 250 words in the answer book provided.</p>
            <p>The task instructions give information about a point of view, argument or problem. They then tell test takers how to discuss this, which may involve providing general factual information, outlining and/or presenting a solution, justifying an opinion, evaluating evidence and ideas.</p>
            <p>Topics are of general interest,  - such as: whether children’s leisure activities should be educational, why families are not so close as they used to be and how they could be brought closer, how environmental problems can be solved, who should pay for the care of old people, whether smoking should be banned in public places.</p>
            <p>Test takers should make sure that they complete the task carefully and provide a full and relevant response. They should organise their ideas clearly and make sure to support their argument with relevant examples (including from their own experience where relevant) or evidence. For this task, test takers need to be able to communicate more abstract and complex ideas and use a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures. Task 2 contributes twice as much to the final Writing band score as Task 1. Therefore, test takers who fail to attempt to answer this task will greatly reduce their chance of achieving a good score.</p>
            <p>Test takers are asked to write at least 250 words and will be penalised if their answer is too short. They should spend no more than 40 minutes on this task.</p>
            <p>Test takers should also note that they will be penalised for irrelevance if the response is off-topic or is not written as full, connected text (e.g. using bullet points in any part of the response, or note form, etc.). They will be severely penalised for plagiarism (i.e. copying from another source).</p>

<h3>IELTS General Training Writing - How it's marked</h3>
<h4>Marking and assessment</h4>
<p>Writing responses are assessed by certificated IELTS examiners. All IELTS examiners hold relevant teaching qualifications and are recruited as examiners by the test centres and approved by the British Council or IDP: IELTS Australia.</p>
<p>Each task is assessed independently. The assessment of Task 2 carries more weight in marking than Task 1.Scores are reported in whole and half bands. Detailed performance descriptors have been developed which describe written performance at the nine IELTS bands. They are available on the <a href="/for-test-takers/how-ielts-is-scored" class="red-text">How IELTS is scored</a> page. The descriptors apply to both the Academic and General Training versions and are based on the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1 responses are assessed on:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Task achievement</li>
    <li>Coherence and cohesion</li>
    <li>Lexical resource</li>
    <li>Grammatical range and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 2 responses are assessed on:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Task response</li>
    <li>Coherence and cohesion</li>
    <li>Lexical resource</li>
    <li>Grammatical range and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance descriptors </h3>
<p><strong>Task 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task achievement</strong> <br>
This assesses how appropriately, accurately and relevantly the response fulfils the requirements set out in the task, using the minimum of 150 words. General Training Writing Task 1 is a writing task with a largely predictable output in that each task sets out the context and purpose of the letter and the functions the test taker should cover in order to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Coherence and cohesion <br>
</strong>This assesses the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organises and links information, ideas and language. Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing. Cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns and conjunctions) to assist in making the conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences clear.</p>
<p><strong>Lexical resource <br>
</strong>This refers to the range of vocabulary the test takers have used and the accuracy and appropriacy of use in terms of the specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy</strong> <br>
This refers to the range and accurate use of grammar, as manifested in the test takers’ sentence writing.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task response</strong> <br>
In both IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training versions, Task 2 requires test takers to formulate and develop a position in relation to a question or statement. Ideas should be supported by evidence, and examples may be drawn from the test takers’ own experience. Responses must be at least 250 words in length. Scripts under the required minimum word limit will be penalised.</p>
<p>The other three assessment criteria (Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy) are the same for Task 1 and Task 2.</p>

<p>
<strong>11–14 minutes</strong><br>
<br>
The speaking section assesses your use of spoken English. Every test is recorded.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Part 1</strong> - the examiner will ask you general questions about yourself and a range of familiar topics, such as home, family, work, studies and interests. This part lasts between four and five minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Part 2</strong>  - you will be given a card which asks you to talk about a particular topic. You will have one minute to prepare before speaking for up to two minutes. The examiner will then ask one or two questions on the same topic.</li>
    <li><strong>Part 3</strong> - you will be asked further questions about the topic in Part 2. These will give you the opportunity to discuss more abstract ideas and issues. This part of the test lasts between four and five minutes.

<h3>IELTS Speaking - How it's marked</h3>
<p><strong>Marking and assessment</strong> </p>
<p>Speaking performances are assessed by certificated IELTS examiners. All IELTS examiners hold relevant teaching qualifications and are recruited as examiners by the test centres and approved by the British Council or IDP: IELTS Australia.</p>
<p>Scores are reported in whole and half bands. Detailed performance descriptors have been developed which describe spoken performance at the nine IELTS bands. These are available on the <a href="/for-test-takers/how-ielts-is-scored" class="red-text">How IELTS is scored</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Fluency and coherence</strong> <br>
This refers to the ability to talk with normal levels of continuity, rate and effort and to link ideas and language together to form coherent, connected speech. The key indicators of fluency are speech rate and speech continuity. The key indicators of coherence are logical sequencing of sentences, clear marking of stages in a discussion, narration or argument, and the use of cohesive devices (e.g. connectors, pronouns and conjunctions) within and between sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Lexical resource</strong> <br>
This criterion refers to the range of vocabulary used and the precision with which meanings and attitudes can be expressed. The key indicators are the variety of words used, the adequacy and appropriacy of the words used and the ability to circumlocute (get round a vocabulary gap by using other words) with or without noticeable hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy <br>
</strong>This refers to the range and the accurate and appropriate use of the test takers' grammatical resource. The key indicators of grammatical range are the length and complexity of the spoken sentences, the appropriate use of subordinate clauses, and the range of sentence structures, especially to move elements around for information focus. The key indicators of grammatical accuracy are the number of grammatical errors in a given amount of speech and the communicative effect of error.</p>
<p><strong>Pronunciation </strong><br>
This criterion refers to the ability to produce comprehensible speech to fulfil the Speaking test requirements. The key indicators will be the amount of strain caused to the listener, the amount of the speech which is unintelligible and the noticeability of L1 influence.</p>
